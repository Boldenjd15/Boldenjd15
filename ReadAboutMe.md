- 👋 Hi, I’m @Boldenjd15 (Aka Jeremy)! Welcome to my Github repo. Here you will find a collection of sample scripts and things
I have written over the course of my career and throughout my educational path with data analytics.

- 👀 I’m interested in exploring new challenges and career opportunities. Having graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with my Master's in 
Data Analytics, I am excited to see what new things I can achieve with my skillets.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to further my skillsets in R, & Python. I also have experience in SQL with database management, as well as Tableau, 
Google Data Studio, and PowerBI in the professional setting. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects as my primary job is project management and database management. This platform will be 
primarily used as a space for me to devel into new ideas or gather from other sources. I would also like to share my experience and examples of 
scripts/work I've done in the past that may benefit others.
